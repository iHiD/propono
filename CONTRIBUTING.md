# How To Contribute

First of all, **thank you** for contributing to this library!

## Issues
Please file issues on the [GitHub issues list](https://github.com/meducation/propono/issues) and give as much detail as possible.

## Features / Pull Requests

If you want a feature implemented, the best way to get it done is to submit a pull request that implements it. Please make sure it has tests.

To get the implementation tests to run, you'll need to create a `test/config.yml` file. There's an example to get you started.

You can run the tests with:

```
bundle exec rake test
```

If you've not contributed to a repository before - this is the accepted pattern to use:

1. Fork it (big button on Github at the top right)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Make your changes (please add tests!)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create new Pull Request on Github

Thank you again!
